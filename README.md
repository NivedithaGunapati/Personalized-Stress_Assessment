# Personalized-Stress_Assessment
My project predicts stress and its reasons from user input, using a trained model on a dataset. It identifies categories like work, exams, relationships, health, and finances, offering tailored recommendations and confidence scores. This personalized tool helps users manage stress by understanding and addressing individual stress factors.
